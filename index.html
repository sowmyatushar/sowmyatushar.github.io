                Bali is the only Hindu-majority province in Muslim-majority Indonesia, 
                with 86.9% of the population adhering to Balinese Hinduism.[3] 
                it is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and 
                modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. 
                The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. 
                Other international events held in Bali include the Miss World 2013 and 
                2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. 
                In March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world's top destination in its
                 Traveller's Choice award, which it also earned in January 2021.[9][10]
